# Chart interaction and composition

## Destination

Deliver the remaining behavior in [Ticket 22](../library-foundation/tickets/22-chart-interaction-and-composition.md).

## Current state

[Ticket 16](tickets/16-radar-visibility.md) implements profile eyes and animated visible-profile
fitting for RadarChart. All 716 tests and repository checks pass. Direct local and remote browser,
keyboard and touch inspection pass. Package validation and independent intent and engineering production reviews pass with no findings.

## Progress

- Reconciled scope accepted in `e899b8e`.
- Cartesian eye controls and automatic animated visible-data scales delivered in `a3ea65b`,
  documented in [ticket 01](tickets/01-cartesian-visibility.md).
- Pointer focus no longer starts or restores a January keyboard reading (`162c5aa`), documented in
  [ticket 02](tickets/02-pointer-reading-focus.md).
- LineChart delivers the approved activation, selection, dragging, indicators, and touch hold
  behavior through its public API, documented in [ticket 03](tickets/03-line-chart-activation-selection.md).
  Public contracts, generated guides, and the rendered showcase are current.

- Line hover emphasis remains independent of month/point targeting, documented in
  [ticket 04](tickets/04-category-hover-emphasis.md). Month mode retains all visible filled centers.

## Frontier

The [decision map](map.md) indexes the remaining work. Frame for bars and Value marker for areas
are settled. Scatter/bubble Centers inside selection is delivered. Radar, heatmap and Sparkline interaction are delivered. Remaining visibility follows. Exploration and the added compositions remain later work.

## Accepted sources

- [Reconciled Ticket 22](../library-foundation/tickets/22-chart-interaction-and-composition.md)
- [Specification](spec.md)
- [Approved activation and selection contract](prototypes/activation-selection.md#accepted-convention)
- [Chart scope](../library-foundation/decisions/13-charting-scope.md#ticket-22-reconciliation)
- [Existing Cartesian interaction](../chart-interactivity/spec.md)

## Verification

[Ticket 16](tickets/16-radar-visibility.md#completion-evidence) records the passing repository,
public type, package and browser checks, plus independent intent and engineering reviews.

## Out of scope

Scatter with adjacent distribution charts, application layouts, implicit statistical calculations,
and any change to the accepted chart palette or existing reading semantics.

## Continuation

- Resume with `python3 /home/whitney-white/.codex/skills/work-system/scripts/navigate.py resume novel-work planning`.
- Branch: `main`; Heatmap interaction is `4567f20`. Sparkline is `f06085b`. Statistical visibility is `3e6a391`. Radar visibility is delivered in the commit containing this record.
- Production showcase: `http://localhost:5174`, Vite session `54846`.
- Next action: settle pie/donut percentages when slices are hidden, then specify that visibility slice. Heatmap row/column visibility still needs its prototype. Histogram and Sparkline visibility are excluded. No owned uncommitted changes remain after this delivery.
